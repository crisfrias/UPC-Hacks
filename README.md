# UPC-Hacks

Since I don’t use a typical Windows setup in my daily life, this repository contains the configurations I use for university applications and services. Here you’ll find:

* How to use the UPC VPN without FortiClient  
* Various aliases and custom configurations that make my university workflow easier  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> This repository reflects my current setup and is continuously evolving. I will keep adding new configurations, tweaks, and improvements as I discover better ways to optimize my university environment.
