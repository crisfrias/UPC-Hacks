# HOW TO USE THE UPC VPN WITHOUR FORTICLIENT #

In this case we're going to use **openfortivpn** in the version 1.23.1 
For making that possible is very important to have the correct dependencies of the needed libraries (i haven't included the correct ones yet)

Also mention that I have tryed in different linux systems, specifically in ones with systemd or without.

I will do the installation using the **apt** packet manager. If you don't use a Debian-based Linux OS just change it with the one you're currently using.
